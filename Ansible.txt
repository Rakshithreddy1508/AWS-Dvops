								ANSIBLE PROCEDURE
Ansible is configuration tool, which is used to configure all the servers (like we have 100 client server) at a time by using one master servers
For this ansible we need SSH configurations..
     FOR example:  we have One MASTER SERVER AND 5 Client severe 
      Create An 6 EC2-SERVERS with linux OS(AMI) , in those 1-Sever is MASTER SERVER
	  Connect to all servers
	  Create Username : ansadmin  and Passwd : **** to all the servers
	   goto cofiguration : visudo --> under withoutpasswd authentication add --> ansadmin 	ALL=(ALL)	NOPASSWD: ALL --> wq! 
	                     : vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config --> make uncoomint the passwd authentication (just remove #) --> wq! --> service sshd restart
                         : Do this process for all the servers...

        Now login to master server and connet all servers using SSH-Key gen , login to user (su - ansadmin)
                                                  : SSH-KEYGEN 
												  : ssh-copy-id (public ip of each serever) one time it will ask passwd enter it and get connect 
												  :now goto root user and install ansible tool
												  : sudo dnf install -y ansible-core (for linux AMI )
												  : check weather ansible is installed (ansible --version)
												  : now goto cd /etc/ansible --> ll --> vi hosts --> add all the ip address of client servers 
												  : like Webserver:(ips of some servers) and Dbserver:(ips of some server) --> wq!
												  : under ansible-config -->> we can change path and forks (forks is used to configure as sets/per)
												  login to user ansadmin
							There are 2 types to execute in clinte server 
								1. AD-HOC Method
								2. Playbook method
                                                  AD-HOC method follows:									 
									PING MODULE : ansible all -m ping --> ping pong connection runs 
									SHELL MODULE : ansible all -m shell -a "uptime" -->> displays time 	
									COPY MODULE : ansible all -m copy -a "src=/Desktop/ABCD dest=/mnt" -b	ABCD file copied to /mnt directory
									File MODULE : ansible all -m file -a "path=/ansadmin/Reddy state=touch" -b  --> FIle Reddy created at ansadmin 
									DIR  MODULE : ansible all -m file -a "path=/ansadmin/Reddy state=mkdir" -b --> Dir Reddy created at ansadmin
									FETCH MODULE : ansible all -m fetch -a "src=/ansadmin/ABCD dest=/tmp" -b --> ABCD File downloaded to /tmp 
									InSTALLATION : ansible all -m yum -a "name=httpd state=installed" -b --> installed Httpd in all servers
									SERVICE : ansible all -m service -a "name=httpd state=started" -b --> started service to  Httpd in all servers											
									 for installation State = installed , latest , present we can use 
									 for removing or deleteing : absent 
									 for service : started , stopped , restart
									        
											       PLAYBOOK METHOD follows:
									This method is used by writing code manually in YAML format 
									TO write code Visual studio code is best
										Example : Client requirment : to install and service enable appace  to all servers 
										            write a code and ececute 
													create a file vi pakg.yml and add the code written at visual studio code
                                    code as follows: 
                                                     ---	(indication of yaml file)								
									                  - name: installing and service enabling appache to all server 
														hosts: all 
														become: yes
														gather_facts : false
														tasks:
														- yum: "name=httpd state=installed/latest/present"
														- service: "name=httpd state=started"
						Note : Inside playbook we can write 'n'no of plays and in plays we can write 'n' no tasks 
														now goto master server and run to execute 
														ansible-playbook pakg.yml --> installation and service enable done to all servers 
									if there is any errors in code means it will dispaly at execution line no of code to reectify 
                           SOME MODULE IN PLAYBOOK AS FOLLOWS BELOW:-->>
							DEBUG MODULE : ---
							                - name: 
											  hosts: all  
											  become: yes
											  tasks:
											  - shells: "bash --version"
									            register: "bash_ver"
											  - debug : "var="bash_ver.stdout.split("/n")[0].split()[3]
											  
												
												
										---
										 - name:
										   hosts:
										   become: yes
										   vars:
										      x:
											  y:
										   tasks:
                                           - debug:
                                               msg:
                                                - "the value of x: {{x}}"
											    - "the value of y: {{y}}"	
												 - "{{x}}+{{y}}={{x+y}}"
